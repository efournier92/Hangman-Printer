##Hangman Printer

Here's some code I wrote to print an ASCII hangman graphic to the CLI.

In addition to printing the graphic, the code also accepts a puzzle word as input, and prints the correct number of spaces below the board.

Finally, the user is asked for the puzzle letters that have already been guessed (separated by commas), and fills them in on the printed spaces.

###Example Output
